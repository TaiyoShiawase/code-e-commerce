- payment not implemented last part would be the order sumamry 

- error and success messages not working but after adding it to cart the quantity will be deducted and it can be seen in the cart 
(access the cart from the homepage or localhost:8080/, we make the 
navbar as partials and included it in every ejs file but some pages wont display the cart icon)
